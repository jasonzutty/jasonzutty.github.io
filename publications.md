|Zutty, J., Carr, D., Talebi, R., Rick, J., Valenta, C., & Rohling, G. (2019, May). Reducing bathymetric-lidar algorithm uncertainty with genetic programming and the evolutionary multi-objective algorithm design engine. In Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Multi-Domain Operations Applications (Vol. 11006, p. 110061U). International Society for Optics and Photonics.|  | This conference paper in SPIE DCS 2019 shows an application of my research in automated machine learning. Here, we used the Evolutionary Multi-objective Algorithm Design Engine (EMADE) to design a signal processing algorithm for computing the depth of water from a LIDAR return. The automatically evolved solution outperformed the industry standard algorithm for this application. 
|Griffies, J. D., Zutty, J., Sarzen, M., & Soorholtz, S. (2018). Wearable sensor shown to specifically quantify pruritic behaviors in dogs. BMC veterinary research, 14(1), 124.|  |This Journal article shows another application of my research with EMADE. Here, we utilized EMADE to create behavior classification algorithms to process accelerometer data from a sensor worn on a dog's collar to improve veterinary care. Once again, the algorithms produced were evolved directly from supervised data and objective functions.
|Zutty, J. P. (2018). Automated machine learning: A biologically inspired approach (Doctoral dissertation, Georgia Institute of Technology).| [Automated Machine Learning: A Biologically Inspired Approach]("https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/60768")| This is my Doctoral thesis. In this culmination of my PhD research, I introduce the Evolutionary Multi-objective Algorithm Design Engine (EMADE) and show its novelty in the field of automated machine learning (autoML).
